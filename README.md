# 🔐 Smart IoT Door Lock System

> This project aims to create a secure and compact smart home system that allows users to remotely lock and unlock physical door locks via a mobile app.

## ⚙️ Hardware
- Built on the MSP32-C3 Super Mini, a microcontroller with Wi-Fi and BLE capabilities.
- Designed with constraints in mind: small PCB footprint, low heat, optimized battery usage, and minimal weight.

## 🔒 Security
A core focus of this project is robust communication security, including:
- Authenticated device-server communication
- Encrypted message transfer (TLS/MQTT)
- Trust validation to prevent spoofing and unauthorized access

## 🎨 Design
Beyond functionality and security, careful attention is paid to the aesthetic and physical design of the device to ensure it integrates seamlessly into modern smart homes.
